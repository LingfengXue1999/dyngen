# dyngen: Synthetic single cell data

Simulate different types of experiments:

* Cellular heterogeneity
* Normal trajectories
* Branched trajectories
* Cycles
* Multiple parallel dynamic processes and their interactions
* Comparing trajectories between
  * Patients
  * Genotypes
  * Similar cell types in different environments
* Integrating different data types prior or after trajectory inference
* Synchronizing trajectories between interacting cells (physically and/or chemically)
* Dynamics of the regulatory network

Get data both for individual cells as well as at the bulk level

Get different data types:

* Gene expression
* Protein expression

Stress test your methods against:

* Noise
* Contamination
