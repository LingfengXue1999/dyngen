Synthetic data for dynamic networks and single cell data

* Normal trajectories
* Branched trajectories
* Cycles
* Multiple parallel dynamic processes...
* ... and their interactions
* Comparing trajectorie between
  * Patients
  * Genotypes
  * Similar cell types (eg. macrophages)
* Integrating different data types prior or after trajectory inference
* Synchronizing trajectories between interacting cells (physically and/or chemically)
* Dynamics of network inference
