# dyngen 0.4.0
Initial release of dyngen on CRAN.

dyngen is a novel, multi-modal simulation engine for
studying dynamic cellular processes at single-cell resolution. dyngen
is more flexible than current single-cell simulation engines. It
allows better method development and benchmarking, thereby stimulating
development and testing of novel computational methods.
